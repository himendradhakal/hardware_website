<h2>3d Scanners </h2>
<h3>With Gavin (and maybe Joe)</h3>

Appearing at the end of the 1970s, laser triangulation technology paved the way for new technology capable of 3D scanning objects. Usually reserved for industrialists, this tool has gradually evolved over time, allowing us to easily find affordable 3D scanners to use for ourselves. These range from a 3D scanner created by Makerbot, to new scanners that can scan underwater. Check out some of the best low cost 3D scanners below.
3D Laser Scanning is a non-contact, non-destructive technology that digitally captures the shape of physical objects using a line of laser light. ... 3D laser scanners measure fine details and capture free-form shapes to quickly generate highly accurate point clouds.
