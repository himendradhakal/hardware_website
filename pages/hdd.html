<h2>Hard Disk Drive - Zach</h2>

<h3>What is a HDD?</h3>

<p>
It is the main and largest data storage hardware device.
Operating systems, applications, files etc. are all stored on a HDD.
HDD’s are commonly used in devices that are meant to be set up and left in one position.
HDD’s are not used in smartphones as moving components in the HDD could potentially be damaged, resulting in data loss, if the device is dropped.
SSD’s are an alternative to HDD’s and are instead used in portable devices (e.g. a laptop, a smartphone, etc.)
The main benefit of using HDD’s instead of SSD’s is that they are much cheaper to manufacture and helps lower the cost of the product.
HDD’s can be internal or external. External HDD’s allow for expandable storage, generally used to store unwanted photos or videos taking up extra memory.

<h3>How an HDD works</h3>

<p>
Unlike volatile memory storage such as RAM, a hard drive keeps the data even when the device is shut down.
The HDD will be powered down when the computer is restarted but the data will still be accessible when it is on.
Sectors within the hard drives, located on tracks, stored within rotating platters allow for the read and write of data.
These platters have magnetic heads on the tip which move with the aid of an actuator arm.
This process allows a HDD to read and write data to the drive.

<h3>Uses of a HDD</h3>

<p>
HDD's are a data storage hardware device.
HDD's are not used in devices that are moved around a lot (e.g. a smartphone) as dropping the device could cause the loss of data as HDD’s contain moving parts.

<h3>Advantages & Disadvantages of a HDD</h3>

<h4>Advantages</h4>

<ul>
<li>More affordable than SSD: A hard disk drive is that it is more affordable than SSD in terms of dollar per gigabit. An SSD with a storage capacity similar with an HDD can be twice as expensive. External HDDs are also cheaper than external SSDs.</li>
<li>Higher storage capacity than SSD: HDD’s are available at varying storage capacity options, usually at a higher base capacity than SSD. 500GB HDDs have now become a standard storage capacity for desktops and external drives. On the other hand, compared with an HDD, computers or devices that use an SSD storage system have a base capacity of 128GB due to it being much more expensive.</li>
</ul>

<h4> Disadvantages</h4>

<ul>
<li>HDD is slower than SSD: Different types of hard disk drives have different read and write speeds, depending on their RPM. SSD’s are faster than HDD’s. A computer with an HDD storage system will boot up slower than SSD. In addition, because an HDD is prone to fragmentation of data because of its rotary recording surface, this also means it is slower than fragmentation-free SSD.</li>
<li>Produces noise while in operation: The spinning of the platter and movement of the magnetic head create mechanical noises during operation. Both spin and movement also create vibrations. Contrastingly, an SDD is essentially noise-free.</li>
</ul>
