<h3>What Is it?</h3>

<p>
A barcode reader, or barcode scanner, is an electronic device for reading
barcodes printed on items such as cans, packaging, and the covers of books or
magazines. A barcode is a sequence of white and black bars.

<h3>How does it work></h3>

Scanning head shines LED or laser light onto barcode.
Light reflects back off barcode into a light-detecting electronic component called a photoelectric cell. White areas of the barcode reflect most light; black areas reflect least.
As the scanner moves past the barcode, the cell generates a pattern of on-off pulses that correspond to the black and white stripes. So for the code shown here ("black black black white black white black black"), the cell would be "off off off on off on off off."
An electronic circuit attached to the scanner converts these on-off pulses into binary digits (zeros and ones).
The binary digits are sent to a computer attached to the scanner, which detects the code as 11101011.

<h3>A little bit of history</h3>

1948: Bernard Silver (1924–1963) and N. Joseph Woodland (1921–) get the idea for developing grocery checkouts that can automatically scan products. Woodland tries various different marking systems, including lines and circles, marks inspired by movie soundtracks, and dots and dashes based on Morse code. In October 1949, the two inventors refine their system to use bullseye patterns and apply for a patent (US Patent #2,612,944), which is granted on October 7, 1952. Their early barcode-scanning equipment uses a conventional lamp to illuminate product labels and a photomultiplier (a crude type of photoelectric cell) to read the light reflected off them. In 1951, Joe Woodland joins IBM to work on barcode technology, though the company declines to purchase his patent, which is acquired by Philco (and later RCA).
