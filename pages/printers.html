            A bit about
        </h2>
        <p>A printer is a machine which is used to create a physical copy of a digital document.<br/>
            <br/>
            Printers take longer to produce output from a computer than a computer.<br/>
            A printed paper copy takes up much more space than a digital copy.<br/>
            <br/>
            However the main advantage of printing data is you have a permanent copy.<br/>
            This copy can be taken away from the computer or accessed when the computer is switched off.<br/>

            The most common type of printer and the least expensive.<br/>
            Spray ink in lines onto the paper from nozzles.<br/>
            Different nozzles spray different colours – different signals from the computer change what is printed
            out.<br/>
            Inkjets can produce a wide range of high quality colour pictures.<br/>
            Useful for a small classroom printer or family printer.<br/>
            However refilling the ink can be just as expensive as buying a new printer.<br/>

            A laser printer uses fine black or coloured toner instead of ink.<br/>
            It contains a drum or cylinder which is coated with static electricity.<br/>
            The pattern of the static electricity is altered by a laser shined onto the drum.<br/>
            The static electricity picks up the toner and makes it stick to the outside of the drum.<br/>
            A piece of paper is then rolled past the drum and the toner drops off the drum printing the image to the
            paper.<br/>
            Laser printers are typically much larger and more expensive.<br/>
            They work a lot faster with the fastest printing 200 a minute – over 3 a second.<br/>
            They typically only print black and white how coloured ones are available.<br/>
            <br/>

        <h2>
            Inkjet vs Laser
        </h2>
        <p>
            Inkjet printers are generally cheaper to buy than laser printers.<br/>
            Although, Laser printers are cheaper to print from with toner costing on average 3.1p per black page.
            Whereas inkjet printers cost over double the price at 6.6p.<br/>
            Inkjet printers are also smaller and take up less space.<br/>
            On the other hand laser printers print much faster.<br/>
            Considering these points laser printers are better for commercial use as they are faster and as more pages
            will be printed – will be a better value for money.<br/>
            Inkjet printers are more favourable for personal, family use as they are initially cheaper and shouldn’t
            need the ink replaced too often.<br/>
            <br/>
        </p>
        <h2>
            Ethics - Disposability
        </h2>
        <p>
            Laser printers have drum and toner cartridge which needs to be replaced or refilled whereas inkjet have lots
            of small parts so you can replace them individually upon a small fault.<br/>
            As well as this, many companies are taking on take-back and remaking schemes to reduce the amount of waste
            that they produce.<br/>
