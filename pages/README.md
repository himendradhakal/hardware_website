Pages
=====

Write a page in the formate of the `template.html` page here.

Open `notepad++` or any text editor and then just write in raw HTML as the `template.html` is written.

Save this file to an appropriate location and then put it on teams. Under `"Files" -> "Hardware Website"`.

It should be self-explanatory how to use basic HTML tags etc.
